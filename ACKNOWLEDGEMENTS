QnetGateway started as g2_ircddb written by Scott Lawson, KI4LKF.

QnetGateway uses IRCDDB software written by Michael Dirska, DL1BFF. Both Scott and
Michael published their code under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. The
current form of QnetGateway would be completely impossible without Scott and
Michael's contribution. Thank you for a great starting point of this current
project!

Some parts of some QnetGateway programs are also inspired by ircDDBGateway,
DStarRepeater and MMDVMHost by Jonathan Naylor G4KLX, and his copyright appears in
those files that used his ideas and in some cases, use his source code.
