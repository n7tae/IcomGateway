IcomGateway has been a pet project for me and my "partner in crime", Colby W1BSB.
Colby has been there with me from the earliest work on QnetIcomGateway, gaining
access to hardware (neither of us has a Ham budget to purchase Icom D-Star
repeater stacks) and basically getting things to work. None of this development
would get done without Colby.

IcomGateway started as g2_ircddb written by Scott, KI4LKF. Scott did a lot of the
early development of IcomGateway by reverse engineering of Icom repeater hardware.
Along with Will W4WWM and Jonathan G4KLX, they laid the groundwork for open-source
digital voice.

IcomGateway uses IRCDDB software written by Michael DL1BFF. Both Scott and
Michael published their code under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. The
current form of IcomGateway would be completely impossible without Scott and
Michael's contribution. Thank you for a great starting point of this current
project!

Some parts of some IcomGateway programs are also inspired by ircDDBGateway, and
MMDVMHost by Jonathan G4KLX, and his copyright appears in those files that used
his ideas and in some cases, use his source code.

The latest on-going work would not be possible without access to Icom hardware.
We gratefully acknowledge both Nick KF5CJG and Mike KK4MA who patiently tested
software on and gave us access to their Icom Repeaters.

IcomGateway continues to be published under Version 2 of the GNU General Public
License, see the LICENSE file.
